# mythoughts
This is just a small project to put into practice some React skills such as the basics and advanced concepts that I have learned. In this App, instead of class components, I use function components to have a more modern and efficient approach. I implemented concepts like css modules and context API for cleaner code and better organization to make it easy to scale and understand the logic.
